This web site is part of the HC MID Chant project.  You can find notes about our work to date on our [github repository README](https://github.com/hcmid), and in the [project wiki](https://github.com/hcmid/chant/wiki).

This site illustrates a few things you can do with our digital editions using short scripts written in Scala.


## 

If you install the interactive build tool [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/), you can replicate these examples to explore our data.





## Documentation with live code


The pages on this site are automatically generated using the [Scala tutorial generator](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut), so that we can embed and execute code.  This guarantees that any examples citing code actually run and can be reliably replicated.


A few topics we want to develop on this web site using live code :


-   how to [generate multiple editions from a single XML source](editions) file
-   how to align neumes and syllables of texts
-   Zipf's Law and the frequency of neumes in manuscripts
-   measuring the melismatic quality of a text
-   using ngrams to identify patterns in neumes and texts
