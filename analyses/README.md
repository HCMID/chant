The CEX files in this directory were generated in August, 2018, from then-current editions.  (Neel Smith and Dan DiCenso used these in their talk at the Cantus Planus Working Group.)

They should be regenerated with updated data, and using updated code libraries extending the `MidReader` and `MidOrthography` traits.
