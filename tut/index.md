This is the planned web site for HC MID chant project.  You can find notes about our work to date on our [github repository README](https://github.com/hcmid), and in the [project wiki](https://github.com/hcmid/chant/wiki).

The pages on this site are automatically generated using the [Scala tutorial generator](https://github.com/tpolecat/tut), so that we can embed and execute code.  This guarantees that any examples citing code actually run and can be reliably replicated.



## Documentation with live code

A few topics we want to develop on this web site using live code :


-   how to generate multiple editions from a single XML source file
-   how to align neumes and syllables of texts
-   Zipf's Law and the frequency of neumes in manuscripts
-   measuring the melismatic quality of a text
-   using ngrams to identify patterns in neumes and texts
